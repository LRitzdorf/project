# Project

Quick project creation tool, with support for various project platforms (coding, CAD, etc)

**This project itself is currently a WIP.**

If anyone reads this, feel free to open an issue listing a system that you use with your own projects!

At the moment, Project is restricted to copying and renaming files. I have plans to expand this later, possibly even including the ability to edit files themselves, e.g. to replace a project name inside the file.
